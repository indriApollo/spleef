A spleef mini game for Minetest

This mod allows you to generate spleef arenas with to-the-top teleporters.
You can set the number of levels, the space between them and their width.
The teleporter moves the players to the top of the active spleef on right click.
You can either make rectangular(default) or circular levels.

Hope you'll enjoy this mod :D

HOWTO :
-------
```/spleef undo | do <size> <nlevels> <space> [square|circle]```
- undo : restore the nodes changed by the latest arena (clean up after game or revert accidental griefing)
- do : generate arena with following parameters (in front right of you)
- size : set the area width (min 3)
- nlevels : set the number of levels
- space : set the space between two levels
- [square|circle] : make rectangular or circular levels (optional)

/!\ The mod does not check for area protections. Be careful were you spawn it to avoid griefing !
